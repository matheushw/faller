# Faller
Faller is a project that aims to detect people falling. Inside the application, you can check out charts related to the phone's accelerometer data. The first graph indicates the most significant acceleration in any of the x, y, or z axis of the accelerometer. The second graph shows the second-greatest acceleration in any of the axis. The third graph shows the acceleration magnitude combining the measured acceleration of all the axis.
